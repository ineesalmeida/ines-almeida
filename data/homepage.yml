  author: "InÃªs Almeida"
  title: ["Software Engineer", "Biomedical Engineer"]
  content: When I am not working, I make Python scripts to analyze data for fun. When I am working, 
    I try to do the same. I see myself as a hardworking generalist that enjoys learning new 
    skills and to be useful in the work I do. In the past year, I have built a small video 
    game from scratch, wrote a neuroscience paper, designed a couple websites and discovered 
    the words most used by my friends on shared chats.
